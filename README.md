Thank you to everyone involved for giving me this opportunity. I throughly enjoyed working through this technical challenge.

## Some Notes

I tried to implement all the functionality I could but at the end I was unable to.

For adding a menu item section in the main menu screen I saved the same of the menu item into the managed context and persistent container. But
I was unable to add the image to the core data and then fetch it when its added. I added print functions within the core data functions: fetchCoreData, saveItem and saveButton pressed
to show to the console that the data is being saved in the persistent container.

Although I was unable to implement all the functionality I still wanted to submit all that I had done and commented out some code to try to explain my thought process.
I am greatful to be able to have given the opportunity to make it this far and hope I am given the opportunity to explain the decisions I made 
and also showcase my thought process for the functionality I was unable to implement. 

Thank You!
